## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Google Apps Script Backend** → Provides core functionality & private API.  
2. **GitHub Pages Frontend** → Makes it installable as a PWA with a custom icon.  
3. **Service Worker** → Enables caching and offline experience.  
4. **Manifest** → Allows the app to appear with its own icon/name like ChatGPT or Gmail.
